## 🎯 Key Analysis & Insights

The dashboard is designed to facilitate detailed statistical exploration and answer key performance questions, including:

### 1. Format Breakdown
* **Performance by Format (Test, ODI, T20I)**: Comparative analysis of batting averages, strike rates, and centuries in each format.
* **Home vs. Away**: Comparison of performance metrics when playing in India versus overseas conditions.

### 2. Time & Trend Analysis
* **Year-by-Year Trends**: Visualization of performance evolution over the years, highlighting peak periods and lean patches.
* **Milestone Tracking**: Detailed view of when and against whom major milestones (e.g., 50s and 100s) were achieved.

### 3. Opponent & Venue Specifics
* **Opponent Dominance**: Identifying the teams against whom Kohli has performed exceptionally well or struggled.
* **Venue Performance**: Analyzing favorite and least favorite grounds based on cumulative runs and averages.
